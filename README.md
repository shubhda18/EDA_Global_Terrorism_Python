Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns. 

EDA is both a science and an art. On the one hand it requires the knowledge of statistics, visualization techniques and data analysis tools like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn etc. On the other hand, it requires asking interesting questions to guide the investigation and interpreting numbers & figures to generate useful insights.

# **Project Outline**

In this project, I have taken the Global Terrorism dataset from the website of [University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/).
Since the dataset contains sensitive information, and I have been given the permission to explore this for academic purpose, kindly do not use the dataset for any pupose other than academic.

We'll use the the python libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and folium, branca to do exploratory data analysis on our dataset.

Project Notebook Includes:

1. Introduction
2. Downloading and importing dataset.
3. Data preparation and cleaning with Pandas
4. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
5. Asking and answering interesting questions
6. Summarizing inferences and drawing conclusions

By the end of the project we'll get an idea on Spread of Terrorism around the World and various Groups responsible for these.
